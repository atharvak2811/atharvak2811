Projects:

1. PDF-Reader

     •	The project uses Python with libraries such as PyPDF2, NLTK, and scikit-learn to create a simple question-answering system for a PDF document.

     • The system extracts text from the PDF, preprocesses it using natural language processing techniques, and employs TF-IDF vectors to find the most relevant sentence when answering user questions, providing a basic but functional interactive interface for querying PDF content.

2. Sign Language Detection
   
     •	Created a comprehensive real-time gesture recognition application integrating Google Media Pipe for object detection, providing users with customizable gestures.

     •	Developed an LSTM model achieving an accuracy of 85% thereby significantly enhancing the precision of gesture recognition within the application.

3. Twitter Clone

     •	Developed a Twitter clone with React, Node, and MongoDB, mirroring core platform functionalities.

     •	Implemented features like tweet posting, user following, and real-time updates for a seamless user experience.

4. Spotify Clone

   •	Created a Spotify clone replicating the music streaming service's interface and functionalities using React, Node and MongoDB.

   •	Implemented user authentication, playlist management, and music playback functionalities to mirror the Spotify experience.

5. Breast Cancer Survival Prediction
   
     •	Conducted extensive data pre-processing and EDA on 'Breast Cancer Factors' dataset for data preparation.

     •	Implemented feature-selection and utilized Machine Learning models (SVM, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict breast cancer survival, selecting the model with the highest accuracy.
