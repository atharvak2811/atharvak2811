Projects:

PDF-Reader

•	The project uses Python with libraries such as PyPDF2, NLTK, and scikit-learn to create a simple question-answering system for a PDF document.

• The system extracts text from the PDF, preprocesses it using natural language processing techniques, and employs TF-IDF vectors to find the most relevant sentence when answering user questions, providing a basic but functional interactive interface for querying PDF content.

Sign Language Detection
 
•	Created a comprehensive real-time gesture recognition application integrating Google Media Pipe for object detection, providing users with customizable gestures.

•	Developed an LSTM model achieving an accuracy of 85% thereby significantly enhancing the precision of gesture recognition within the application.
